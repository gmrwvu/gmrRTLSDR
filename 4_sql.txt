#as of 2/7/23 the db only has downlink format 17 and 18
#should I further filter out all except TC 9 to 22
#should be no dups there
#this filter is in adsb.flt
#and still get dups - many of them - evne w/out replay attack
#so cosine sim is a good choice


 select icao, count(*)
   from adsb
   group by icao;

 select data, count(*) as cnt
   from adsb
   group by data
   having cnt > 1;

GET ALL THE DATA BLOCK DUPS, HERE THE DUPS MAY HAVE SAME ICAO
PROBLEM IS GETTING SAME ICAO AS WELL AS DIFFERENT ICAO
create table dups as
select data, count(*) as cnt
   from adsb
   group by data
   having cnt > 1;

GET DISTRIBUTION OF DATA BLOCK DUPS
select cnt, count(*)
   from dups
   group by cnt;

PUT ICAO AND DATA BLOCK ONLY OF DATA BLOCKS THAT ARE DUPS
INTO A TABLE FOR EASIER ANALYSIS
create table adsb_dup as 
select ICAO, adsb.data
from adsb, dups
where adsb.data = dups.data;

TO GET SAME UNIQUE DATA-ICAO COMBINATIONS
select data, icao, count(*) as cnt
from adsb_dup
group by data, ICAO;
TOO MANY TO MANUALLY REVIEW

THIS DOES NOT WORK RIGHT
NEED TO COLLAESCE FIELDS WITH - BETWEEN THEM
DO DISTINCT ON THE COALSED
PUT THAT UNIQE SET OF VALUES IN DATA_DUP
BUT SEPRATE THEM FIRST
TO GET same data with differnt ICAO, CREATE TABLE WITH ABOCVE 
TO MAKE FOR EASIER ANALYSIS0
create table data_dups as
select data, icao, count(*) as cnt
from adsb_dup
group by data, ICAO;

TO FIND OUT IF THE SAME DATA BLOCK HAS DIFFERENT ICAOS SO CANNOT RELY ON JUST A SINGLE LOOKUP MATCH
select data, count(*)
from data_dups
group by data
having count(*) > 1;

THERE ARE DIFFERENT ICAOS FOR A GIVEN DATA BLIOCK
FOR EXAMPLE
select * from data_dups where data = '99915D8E78808A';
sqlite> select * from data_dups
   ...> where data = '99917E8158708B';
data            icao    cnt
--------------  ------  ---
99917E8158708B  A5ECB7  1
99917E8158708B  ABC7C6  1

AND

sqlite> select * from data_dups
   ...> where data = '990D739810049B';
data            icao    cnt
--------------  ------  ---
990D739810049B  A4D7E4  14
990D739810049B  A752EA  3
990D739810049B  AC6445  1
990D739810049B  AC91D4  1
990D739810049B  AD10EC  1
990D739810049B  AD237F  15

select * from data_dups where data = '99216680584C8C';


TO GET HIGHEST COUNT IN THIS DATA
select data, count(*)
from data_dups
group by data
having count(*) > 4;

GET DISRTRIBUTION OF DUPS
MAKE TABLE FOR EASIER QUERIES
create table ICAO_dup_dist as
select data, count(*) as cnt
from data_dups
group by data
having count(*) > 1;

TO GET DIST OF ICAO DUPS
select cnt, count(*)
from ICAO_dup_dist
group by cnt;

TO GET THE ICAOS THAT HAVE SAME DATA BLOCK AS ANOTHER ICAO
select ICAO from ICAO_dup_dist i, adsb a
where i.data = a.data;

PUT IN TABLE FOR EASIER QUERY
create table ICAO_dups as
select ICAO from ICAO_dup_dist i, adsb a
where i.data = a.data;

TO GET COUNT OF ICAOS WITH DUPS
select count(distinct ICAO) from ICAO_dups;

TO GET COUNT OF TOTAL ICAOs
select count( distinct ICAO) from adsb;
=================================

select distinct count(icao)
 from adsb;

select count(distinct icao) from adsb;
