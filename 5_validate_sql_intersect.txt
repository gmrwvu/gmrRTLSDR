To verify the cosine assignment between two ICAOs
this sql script gets the two ICAO message sets
as two independetn queries and then does the sql
set operation of intersection to find how many
message duplicates they share in common
% and cosine score have a direct correlation
so we can use this as a reasonableness check

pair 1
0D0733	 A7CB67	0.00317957

pair 2
A02C94	 A34AE0	0.057142922

pair 3
C00EC2	 C015B0	0.030551055

pair 1
select msg from adsb where ICAO = '0D0733'
intersect
select msg from adsb where ICAO = 'A7CB67';
990D8393C8089D
990D8493C0089D

2 messages in common both having same value
0D0733 has 824 so messages shared are .2%
A7CB67 has 1008 so messages shared are .2%
This reasonable

19 messages in common, some duplicates 
A34AE0 has 624 so messages shared are 3%
A02C94 has 355 so messages shared are 5%
This is reasonable
